# Reproduced-DeepMind-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

This is my personal reproduction of DeepMind Deep Reinforcement Learning, based on the git repository
https://github.com/NervanaSystems/simple_dqn, implementing the algorithm in the DeepMind's paper 
"Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning
(http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html).  The repsitory is also based on NervanaSystems 
deep learning package neon (http://neon.nervanasys.com/index.html/)

The evaluation system is based on open-ai/gym (https://github.com/openai/gym) for developing and comparing reinforcement
learning algorithms.


My system is macOS Sierra, with 4-core 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7, and Nvidia GeForce GT 650M

The test results are in Test-Seaquest-v0.zip and Test-SpaceInvaders-v0.zip, and the training results (first 10 epoches of Breakout) are in Train-Breakout-v0.zip.
